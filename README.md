# Brocard's Problem

Find integer pairs (n,m) that satisfy the following:
```
n! + 1 = m^2
```
Pairs (n, m) that exist are called Brown numbers [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocard%27s_problem).
As of 2020, only three known pairs have been found:
```
(4,5), (5,11), (7,71)
```
This repository contains a short program I wrote after watching a Numberphile video that introduced this unsolved problem in mathematics [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Djj6pfR9KU). The program only checks up to n = 100, as the time complexity of this program would make solving larger values a waste of time. Check out the repository of the team that checked n values up to a quadrillion [[3]](https://github.com/jhg023/brocard).
